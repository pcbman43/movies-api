        A movies API that allows users to view movies and their data (movie name, rating, the year it came
        out, and a poster).

        Administrators can edit this data, this includes adding, modifying and deleting movie entries, along
        with viewing logs about movie changes.



        Testing steps:


        1. **Signing in**


        Click the `Authorize` button, then fill out the `BasicAuth (http, Basic)` fields with the default
        administrator credentials:


        * `Username: Admin`

        * `Password: Password`


        and click the `Authorize` button beneath the fields.


        ---


        Click on the `POST` "/sessions" path, under the `sessions` tag, under that click `Try it out` and
        `Execute`.


        The server will respond with a "sessionId" value, copy it then return to the initial `Authorize`
        button and click on it.


        The sessionId value will look something like this:


        `63fad44e-64ce-4a82-868f-846ffb1db74c`


        Paste the acquired sessionId into the `Bearer (http, Bearer)` `Value` field and press the `Authorize`
        button beneath it.


        ## You are now authorized to make changes to the movie database.

        ### e.g. `POST` adding, `DELETE` deleting and `PATCH` modifying movie entries.

        ---


        2. **Making changes to the movies database**


        2.1 **Getting the list of movies**


        Click on the `GET` "/movies" path, under the `movies` tag, under that click `Try it out` and
        `Execute`.


        The server will respond with a list of movies.


        2.2 **Adding a movie**


        Click on the `POST` "/movies" path, under the `movies` tag, under that click `Try it out`, then select
        a request body and modify it. After that click `Execute`.


        If the server responds with an empty body, that means the request went through and was accepted, you
        can verify the addition of a movie with the `GET` "/movies" method.


        2.3 **Modifying a movie**


        Click on the `PATCH` "/movies" path, under the `movies` tag, under that click `Try it out`, then
        select a request body and modify it. After that click `Execute`.


        If the server responds with an empty body, that means the request went through and was accepted, you
        can verify the modification to the movie entry with the `GET` "/movies" method.


        2.4 **Deleting a movie**


        Click on the `DELETE` "/movies" path, under the `movies tag`, under that click `Try it out`, then
        select a request body and modify it. After that click `Execute`.


        If the server responds with an empty body, that means the request went through and was accepted, you
        can verify the removal of a movie entry with the `GET` "/movies" method.

        3.1 **Getting the change logs from the server**


        Click on the `GET` "/logs" path, under the `logs` tag, under that click `Try it out` and `Execute`.


        The server will respond with a list of log entries.


        3.2 **Getting the .env variables from the server**


        Click on the `GET` "/env" path, under the `env` tag, under that click `Try it out` and `Execute`.
